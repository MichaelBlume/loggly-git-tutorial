gitk is pretty much the best thing since sliced bread. Try running 

gitk --all

on any repo you use. You'll get a birds-eye view of all the work going on in
all branches of that repo, and of what's been merged into what.

Further, *if* you entered gitk with a clean working directory (see 'stashing'),
you can check out any branch you see in the graph, move that branch to some
other point in the graph, and cherry-pick other commits onto it. This is really
cool, because you can basically create a branch anywhere you like, with any
commits you like, and graphically see the history you're creating as you build
it.

rebase -i is often faster though

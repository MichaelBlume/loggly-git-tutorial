This tutorial's going to be just a bit opinionated. In my examples, I'm going
to assume a configuration of git that isn't quite the default one, so if you
want to be able to just paste in commands from these docs, you should copy some
of my configs.

The git config command changes your git configuration (not surprisingly).
Without the --global flag, it'll change the config *only for the repo you're
in.*  With the --global flag, it'll change it everywhere. You can see your full
project level git config by running vim .git/config at root level in your
project. You can see your global git config by running vim ~/.gitconfig

These statements will configure git a bit for you:

git config --global user.name "Your Name" # Make your commits identify their author
git config --global user.email "you@loggly.com" # If github knows this e-mail,
                                                # your commits will be
                                                # associated with your github user

git config --global core.editor [vim|emacs] # pick one. Or something else.

# Pushing

# This will make git *only push the branch you're on* by default.
git config --global push.default current

# Git Log

# This will let you know where other branches/remotes are when you use git log
git config --global log.decorate short

# Other nice-to-have stuff

I'd recommend looking it over

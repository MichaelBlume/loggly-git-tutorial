Setting up a new clone from scratch

Major software repos with multiple developers should have many github forks --
a main repo in the loggly account, and a fork for each developer. If you're
working on a project and don't have your own fork of it, please click the
'fork' button at the top of the repo's main page in the loggly profile

Within your fork, copy down the url given for the repo here:

(url.png)

then, wherever you want to put your clone, run

git clone <that-url>

This may take a bit.

Now your clone can talk to your fork of the repo. But you also want to be able
to talk to the main loggly fork, if only to get code checked in by your
collaborators. So go back to the loggly page you forked from, copy the url
there, and do

(loggly-url.png)

git remote add loggly <loggly-url>

Now run

git remote --verbose

and git will tell you which repos you currently communicate with. It should
look something like this:

[10:31][mike@mikebook:~/workspace/web/media/js(coffee)]$ git remote --verbose
loggly  git@github.com:loggly/media.git (fetch)
loggly  git@github.com:loggly/media.git (push)
origin  git@github.com:MichaelBlume/media.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:MichaelBlume/media.git (push)

Adjusting an existing clone

If you've already cloned one of your repos, but don't think you're pointing to
the two forks as above, you can fix that. Grab the two urls, as above, and then
do

git remote set-url origin <your-url>
git remote add loggly <loggly-url>

Adding more remotes

Let's say you want to check out some code one of your colleauges has in their
fork. You can add them like so

git remote add <their-name> <their-repo-url>

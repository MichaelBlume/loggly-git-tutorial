To use git, you'll need git (amazing, isn't it?)

I'm assuming a sort of classical setup where you're SSHing from a mac to a VM.

Your VM probably has git and gitk. To use gitk, your mac needs to forward X11
when it SSHs in. You might want to alias 'ssh' to 'ssh -X' or something. Gitk's
pretty great, and I'll be using it in this tutorial

If you're working directly on your mac, you might not have gitk. Haven't
figured out how to fix that yet.

You'll also need an account on github. That's generally pretty straightforward.

To get git on your VM to talk to github, you'll need github to have your public
key. On your VM, run ssh-keygen. It'll ask you about a passphrase, but (Jordan
may kill me for saying this) you can ignore that. Unless you're storing a key
on a laptop, there's no need to encrypt it. It'll ask you to name the key, but
the default is fine.

Now run

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

and you'll get some incomprehensible output. You can go to personal settings on
github and paste that in, and magically your box will be able to push and pull
from github.
